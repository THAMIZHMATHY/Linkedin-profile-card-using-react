A LinkedIn-inspired profile card developed using React. 
This project demonstrates component-based architecture, reusable props, and modern CSS styling to create clean and professional user interface designs.

The profile card displays user information such as profile image, name, role, bio, and social links, similar to professional networking platforms.

Built to strengthen my React fundamentals and front-end development skills.
